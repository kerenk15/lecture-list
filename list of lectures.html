<h2> Global Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Crop insurance, an idea worth seeding</b>
	<p><cite>Rose Goslinga</cite> <time datetime="2014-08-13T18:00z">13/8/14 , 18:00 - 19:00</time></p>
	<p>Across sub-Saharan Africa, small farmers are the bedrock of national and regional economies unless the weather proves unpredictable and their crops fail. The solution is insurance, at a vast, continental scale, and at a very low, affordable cost.

	<p>Facebook's "like" and "share" buttons are seen 22 billion times a day, making them some of the most-viewed design elements ever created. Margaret Gould Stewart, Facebook's director of product design, outlines three rules for design at such a massive scale-one so big that the tiniest of tweaks can cause global outrage, but also so large that the subtlest of improvements can positively impact the lives of many</p></li>
